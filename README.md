# Production Connect

A full-stack web application designed to simplify how businesses connect with video editors for their video production needs. Rather than going through several proposals from various editors, businesses can be connected to an editor that meets their needs at a click of a button.

## Technologies Used & Features

Production Connect's front-end is built with React, while the back-end is powered by Express and Node.js, with MongoDB serving as the database. The application enables secure account creation with jwt authentication for users. Project managers can create job listings detailing their video editing needs and connect with available editors.
