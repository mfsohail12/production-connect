## Implementation Notes

### server/controllers/authController.js
**Issue:** Removed arbitrary _id usage and used req.user.id from decoded JWT. Stripped protected fields (role, password) from updates. Added runValidators and select to exclude password. Login now issues tokens with expiry.

**Security Notes:** Ensure auth middleware populates req.user securely. Never trust client-provided IDs. Include token expiration.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken')

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Attempt to update another user's profile; expect 403
- Ensure login token expires after 1h

---

### server/controllers/projectController.js
**Issue:** Added lookup of project and explicit check that the JWT user id matches project.owner. Returns 403 if not owner.

**Security Notes:** Ensure req.user is set by secure auth middleware. Do not allow mass updates of owner field.

**Additional Dependencies:**
None

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Try editing/deleting another userâ€™s project; expect 403

---

### server/controllers/jobController.js
**Issue:** Added role checks for admin-only operations and ensure that only the assigned editor or admin can quit a job.

**Security Notes:** All endpoints in jobController should enforce role or ownership validation.

**Additional Dependencies:**
None

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Non-admin cannot assign editor
- Unassigned user cannot quit job

---

### server/helpers/auth.js
**Issue:** Enforced Bearer token pattern validation. Added expiresIn to JWT. Increased bcrypt salt rounds.

**Security Notes:** Rotate JWT_SECRET periodically. Handle token errors gracefully in middleware.

**Additional Dependencies:**
None

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Verify invalid format tokens are rejected
- Ensure expired tokens throw error

---

### server/middleware.js
**Issue:** Replaced boolean return with full JWT verification. Attached decoded payload to req.user. Added error handling and 401 responses.

**Security Notes:** All protected routes must use this middleware. Avoid swallowing JWT errors.

**Additional Dependencies:**
None

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Call protected route without token
- Call with malformed token

---

### server/routes/authRoutes.js
**Issue:** Added auth middleware to delete-account endpoint so only logged-in users can delete their own account.

**Security Notes:** deleteAccount should internally validate req.user.id.

**Additional Dependencies:**
None

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Attempt delete without token
- Delete with token from another user

---

### server/routes/jobRoutes.js
**Issue:** Applied auth middleware to all job routes and rely on controller for role checks.

**Security Notes:** Consider adding granular role-based middleware later.

**Additional Dependencies:**
None

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Access routes without token
- Access assign as non-admin

---

### server/routes/projectRoutes.js
**Issue:** Ensured all project routes use authentication and rely on controller-level ownership checks.

**Security Notes:** listProjects may need to filter by owner if desired.

**Additional Dependencies:**
None

**Testing Recommendations:**
- List projects returns only allowed

---

### server/server.js
**Issue:** Separated public auth endpoints under /auth and protected APIs under /api/*. Prevents accidental exposure of protected endpoints.

**Security Notes:** Ensure environment configs lock down CORS, rate limiting.

**Additional Dependencies:**
None

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Verify /auth endpoints accessible
- Verify /api endpoints reject unauthenticated
