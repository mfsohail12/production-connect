## üö® Vulnerability Summary

### High Risk Files (2)

#### 1. authController.js (JavaScript)
- **Path:** `server/controllers/authController.js`
- **Type:** API
- **Risk:** Handles authentication flows and JWT issuance/update without strong ownership checks; allows users to update any profile by supplying arbitrary _id.

#### 2. projectController.js (JavaScript)
- **Path:** `server/controllers/projectController.js`
- **Type:** API
- **Risk:** Edit and delete endpoints do not verify project ownership; arbitrary authenticated users can modify or delete any project.


### Medium Risk Files (7)

#### 1. jobController.js (JavaScript)
- **Path:** `server/controllers/jobController.js`
- **Type:** API
- **Risk:** No role or ownership checks on editor activation, assignment, or job quitting; any authenticated user can manipulate editor status or jobs.

#### 2. auth.js (JavaScript)
- **Path:** `server/helpers/auth.js`
- **Type:** OTHER
- **Risk:** Token extraction and password hashing helper; missing validation of token format and no token expiration handling.

#### 3. middleware.js (JavaScript)
- **Path:** `server/middleware.js`
- **Type:** API
- **Risk:** JWT verification returns boolean only; decoded payload is discarded, potential bypass of authorization and lacking error handling.

#### 4. authRoutes.js (JavaScript)
- **Path:** `server/routes/authRoutes.js`
- **Type:** API
- **Risk:** Delete-account endpoint lacks authentication middleware; allows account deletion without verifying caller identity.

#### 5. jobRoutes.js (JavaScript)
- **Path:** `server/routes/jobRoutes.js`
- **Type:** API
- **Risk:** Applies generic auth but no further role-based access control for job endpoints.

#### 6. projectRoutes.js (JavaScript)
- **Path:** `server/routes/projectRoutes.js`
- **Type:** API
- **Risk:** Applies generic auth but controller lacks ownership checks; routes expose critical project operations.

#### 7. server.js (JavaScript)
- **Path:** `server/server.js`
- **Type:** CONFIG
- **Risk:** Mounting of authRoutes and middleware is ambiguous; all routes under same prefix may lead to unintended public access.


### Low Risk Files (5)

#### 1. postcss.config.js (JavaScript)
- **Path:** `client/postcss.config.js`
- **Risk:** Build configuration for CSS processing; no direct security impact.

#### 2. tailwind.config.js (JavaScript)
- **Path:** `client/tailwind.config.js`
- **Risk:** TailwindCSS configuration; purely presentation.

#### 3. vite.config.js (JavaScript)
- **Path:** `client/vite.config.js`
- **Risk:** Development server and build tool settings; not exposed to end users.

#### 4. project.js (JavaScript)
- **Path:** `server/models/project.js`
- **Risk:** Mongoose schema definition only; no queries or input handling.

#### 5. user.js (JavaScript)
- **Path:** `server/models/user.js`
- **Risk:** Mongoose schema definition only; no direct security concerns.


## üîß Security Fixes Provided


### 1. server/controllers/authController.js
**Vulnerability:** AUTHORIZATION_FAILURE  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** No

**Explanation:** Removed arbitrary _id usage and used req.user.id from decoded JWT. Stripped protected fields (role, password) from updates. Added runValidators and select to exclude password. Login now issues tokens with expiry.

**Security Notes:** Ensure auth middleware populates req.user securely. Never trust client-provided IDs. Include token expiration.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken')

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Attempt to update another user's profile; expect 403
- Ensure login token expires after 1h

---

### 2. server/controllers/projectController.js
**Vulnerability:** AUTHORIZATION_FAILURE  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** No

**Explanation:** Added lookup of project and explicit check that the JWT user id matches project.owner. Returns 403 if not owner.

**Security Notes:** Ensure req.user is set by secure auth middleware. Do not allow mass updates of owner field.

**Additional Dependencies:**
None

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Try editing/deleting another user‚Äôs project; expect 403

---

### 3. server/controllers/jobController.js
**Vulnerability:** AUTHORIZATION_FAILURE  
**Confidence:** MEDIUM  
**Breaking Changes:** No

**Explanation:** Added role checks for admin-only operations and ensure that only the assigned editor or admin can quit a job.

**Security Notes:** All endpoints in jobController should enforce role or ownership validation.

**Additional Dependencies:**
None

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Non-admin cannot assign editor
- Unassigned user cannot quit job

---

### 4. server/helpers/auth.js
**Vulnerability:** SESSION_MANAGEMENT_FLAW  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** No

**Explanation:** Enforced Bearer token pattern validation. Added expiresIn to JWT. Increased bcrypt salt rounds.

**Security Notes:** Rotate JWT_SECRET periodically. Handle token errors gracefully in middleware.

**Additional Dependencies:**
None

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Verify invalid format tokens are rejected
- Ensure expired tokens throw error

---

### 5. server/middleware.js
**Vulnerability:** AUTHENTICATION_BYPASS  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** No

**Explanation:** Replaced boolean return with full JWT verification. Attached decoded payload to req.user. Added error handling and 401 responses.

**Security Notes:** All protected routes must use this middleware. Avoid swallowing JWT errors.

**Additional Dependencies:**
None

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Call protected route without token
- Call with malformed token

---

### 6. server/routes/authRoutes.js
**Vulnerability:** AUTHORIZATION_FAILURE  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** No

**Explanation:** Added auth middleware to delete-account endpoint so only logged-in users can delete their own account.

**Security Notes:** deleteAccount should internally validate req.user.id.

**Additional Dependencies:**
None

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Attempt delete without token
- Delete with token from another user

---

### 7. server/routes/jobRoutes.js
**Vulnerability:** AUTHORIZATION_FAILURE  
**Confidence:** MEDIUM  
**Breaking Changes:** No

**Explanation:** Applied auth middleware to all job routes and rely on controller for role checks.

**Security Notes:** Consider adding granular role-based middleware later.

**Additional Dependencies:**
None

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Access routes without token
- Access assign as non-admin

---

### 8. server/routes/projectRoutes.js
**Vulnerability:** AUTHORIZATION_FAILURE  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** No

**Explanation:** Ensured all project routes use authentication and rely on controller-level ownership checks.

**Security Notes:** listProjects may need to filter by owner if desired.

**Additional Dependencies:**
None

**Testing Recommendations:**
- List projects returns only allowed

---

### 9. server/server.js
**Vulnerability:** INSECURE_CONFIGURATION  
**Confidence:** MEDIUM  
**Breaking Changes:** No

**Explanation:** Separated public auth endpoints under /auth and protected APIs under /api/*. Prevents accidental exposure of protected endpoints.

**Security Notes:** Ensure environment configs lock down CORS, rate limiting.

**Additional Dependencies:**
None

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Verify /auth endpoints accessible
- Verify /api endpoints reject unauthenticated

---
